### How to help

Generally, ungoogled-chromium needs maintainers to help:

* Keep up-to-date with the latest stable Chromium, and any problematic changes in the new version that needs modification.
* Implement feature requests ("enhancements" in the Issue Tracker), large or small.

In addition, anyone is free to help others in need of support in the Issue Tracker.

Issues marked with the `help wanted` tag are changes that needs discussion or assistance.

* If it requires new code, please read through the [Submitting changes](#submitting-changes) section below.
* If you want to work on an issue, please state your intent to do so first to let others know.

If there are fixes, tweaks, or additions you want to make, continue onto the following section.

### Submitting changes

Please submit all changes via Pull Requests.

Guidelines:

* You are welcome to submit minor changes, such as bug fixes, documentation fixes, and tweaks.
* If you want to submit a new feature, please read through the [Criteria for new features](#criteria-for-new-features) below.
* When in doubt about the acceptance of a change, you are welcome to ask via an issue first.

### Criteria for new features

1. New features should not detract from the default Chromium experience, unless it falls under the project's main objectives (i.e. removing Google integration and enhancing privacy).

    * For larger features, please propose them via an issue first.

2. New features should live behind a setting that is **off by default**.

    * Settings are usually added via a command-line flag and `chrome://flags` entries. See [the relevant section in docs/developing.md](developing.md#adding-command-line-flags-and-chromeflags-options) for more information.
    * Unless there are significant benefits, adding the setting to `chrome://settings` is *not recommended* due to the additional maintenance required (caused by the infrastructure that backs preferences).

**NOTE**: In the event that the codebase changes significantly for a non-essential patch (i.e. a patch that does not contribute to the main objectives of ungoogled-chromium), it will be removed until someone updates it.
