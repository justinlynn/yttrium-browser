# Support

**Before you submit feedback, please ensure you have tried the following**: 

* Read the [FAQ](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki/faq)
* Check if your feedback already exists in the [Issue Tracker](//github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues) (make sure to search closed issues and use search filters, as applicable)
* If this is a problem, ensure it does *not* occur with regular Chromium or Google Chrome. If it does, then this is *not* a problem with ungoogled-chromium. Instead, please submit your feedback to the [Chromium bug tracker](//bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list) or Google.
* Read the documentation under [docs/](docs/)

There are two channels for support:

* The [Issue Tracker](//github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues). The Issue Tracker is the main hub for discussions and development activity, and thus the primary means of support. It includes problems, suggestions, and questions.
* A chat room. There are two options available:
    * [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ungoogled-software/Lobby). It can use your GitHub account as an identity.
    * Matrix.org under name `ungoogled-software/lobby`. It has a bidirectional connection with Gitter.
